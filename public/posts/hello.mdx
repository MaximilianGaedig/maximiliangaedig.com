Today I created my blog, using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).
I plan to post here about my journey and my projects.
It's not finished yet tho, I have plans to add a RSS feed and a search engine, and add other general improvements.

That's all for now, hope you will enjoy it! :)

#### Edit (2022-10-22):
Over the weeks I added the RSS feed, just the button was missing, today I added it,
it took me a while as I had a lot of other things to do, of course I didn't work on this the whole time,
but I will finally push the changes today.
Along the way I added numerous fixes and improvements, and I also forgot to mention I am using [Redis](https://redis.io/) to store views which I now fixed.
Tho redis is normally just used as a cache, it can be used as a simple persistent database too,
I chose it over for ex. postgres for it's simple interface, just provide a key and a value and it's done.
Additionally I added in link functionality for non-javascript users, now they can use the links normally without the next js router.
